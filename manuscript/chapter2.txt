# Guiding questions

For the sake of brevity, the Junior Dev Auckland User Group will be referred to as JDA for the remainder of this booklet.

## Who runs JDA?

JDA is run by volunteers. It has a standing organising committee of 3-5 people. We have a hard limit on the number of organising committee members because over a certain size the work to align and collaborate becomes more than the benefit of the additional capacity provided.

If an existing committee member steps down, the remaining organising committee determine if they want to fill the space.
Anyone can be put forward for consideration (volunteer themself, put forward by person stepping down) but the decision on whether they become a committee member sits with the remaining organising committee and is determined by majority vote.

Committee members are expected to be reguarly involved in UG meetings but are not required to be at every event.
New committee members are taken on for a 3 month trial before becoming full fledged members. This gives the new member time to establish if they understood exactly what they were getting involved in, as well as allowing the existing committee to determine if they work well together.

Attend when you can, we like to see regular faces but also welcome the once off visitors.
The user group is for learning. We don't expect attendees to actively be recruiting during the meeting.

## Are there other chapters of Junior Dev?

We believe there are other chapers of Junior Dev out there however we are not sure if they are still running and we have no requirement to have aligned values, views of meeting formats.
