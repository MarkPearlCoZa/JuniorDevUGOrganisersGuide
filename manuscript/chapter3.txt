# Code of Conduct

The following has been influenced by other communities we respect and believe hold strong values. It’s alive! This is a living doc so please let us know if you have any thoughts. This code applies to all JuniorDev initiatives both online and in person. 
Organisers will adhere to this code throughout all the JuniorDev events and we expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for e.v.e.r.y.b.o.d.y!

## Some dos before the don’ts

We’re all about being buds! This community started with the intention to bring together Junior Developers of all kinds to share in experiences, learn about each other and make lasting friendships. Some tips to help this happen include…

Don’t stand in closed circles. It can be hard enough approaching strangers without physical barriers. Try to not stand in circles that don’t let any new people in.
Talk to someone you don’t know. Hopefully you’ve made friends in the JuniorDev community, but there was probably a point before you knew faces in the crowd. Make newbie’s feel welcome by saying hi!
No dissing tech stacks. Let’s leave the trash talk to the trolls. JuniorDev isn’t aligned to any particular tech and we like to treat all stacks with love
[No feigning surprise](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/04/27/no-feigning-surprise/). Take each others unknowns as a chance to teach. 

## Tl;dr

Be Nice, Be Supportive, Be Honest, Be Open.

## Using many more words

Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of…

Gender identity and expression
Age
Sexual orientation
Disability
Physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity
Religion (or lack thereof)
Technology choices

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form! The following behaviour will not be tolerated...

Use of sexual language and imagery.
Deliberate intimidation.
Stalking, following.
Harassing photography or recording. It’s not OK to record someone's whole talk without their consent, and listen to people when they say they don’t want to be photographed.
Constantly interrupting speakers. Questions are ok (if the speaker has indicated as such), what’s not ok is a repeated barrage of questions that are only asked make you look smart.
Inappropriate physical contact.
Unwelcome sexual attention.

What we'll do bout it

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately in person for immediate action. Alternatively, after the incident you can contact the JuniorDev team at any time through the [JuniorDev Auckland meetup site](https://www.meetup.com/JuniorDev-Auckland/)

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers will take any action they deem appropriate, including verbal warning, suspension or expulsion from the community and event venue.

Privacy and dignity of the incident reporter and person being harassed is our primary focus. We will act in support of the victim and not force any action that is not agreed upon them.

If it has been deemed that you acted inappropriately

Listen to the complaint with an open mind
Don’t be dismissive of the complainant
Understand any advice given on how to act in the future
Comply with the directions of the JuniorDev organisers

We hope that the JuniorDev Auckland community is a positive and safe space for all. Failure to comply with the above code of conduct may result in expulsion from the JuniorDev Auckland community. If you’d like to discuss the guidelines above please reach out to the organisers.
