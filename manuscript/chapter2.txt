# Guiding questions

For the sake of brevity, the Junior Dev Auckland User Group will be referred to as JDA for the remainder of this booklet.

## Who runs JDA?

JDA is run by an organising committee.

## How does JDA meet?

JDA is an in person user group. We meet face to face in Auckland. We do not live stream meetings because we feel this detracts and complicates the in person meetings.

## What does JDA UG meetings look like?

Our standard monthly meeting consists of two speakers - first speaker covers a topic for 10 minutes, second speaker covers a topic for 20 minutes.

Start time
Mingling - 15 minutes
Welcomes - 5 minutes
First speaker - 10 minutes
Second speaker - 20 minutes
Food / conversation - 30 minutes

Total meeting time ~ 60 to 70 minutes.

## Are there other chapters of Junior Dev?

We believe there are other chapers of Junior Dev out there however we are not sure if they are still running and we have no requirement to have aligned values, views of meeting formats.

## What does JuniorDev UG's volunteer leadership opportunities look like?

Various organiser responsibilities include:

* Organising / booking the venue
* Organising food for each meeting
* Confirming speakers for each event
* Introducing speakers, giving gifts, 
* Preparing gifts for speakers
* Updating meetup for new events
* Identifying and approaching new speakers and topics

## What are your JuniorDev UG attendee expectations?

Attend when you can, we like to see regular faces but also welcome the once off visitors.
The user group is for learning. We don't expect attendees to actively be recruiting during the meeting.
