# History 

The JuniorDev Auckland User Group started in April 2018. It was formed as a chapter of the larger JuniorDev User Group with other chapters located in Australia and other parts of the world.  

Junior Dev Auckland User Group continued to meet regularly from April 2018 to November 2019 at which point the original organisers stepped down and regular meetings stopped happening.

In November 2020 the group was started up again by Mark and  Hitarth, who were soon joined by Audrey, Hamish & Raymond. The aim of the user group stayed the same, to continue supporting new software developers in their career and professional development. 
Since 2020, the group has met semi-regularly, at first having monthly meetings and then over time moving to a meeting every second month.
