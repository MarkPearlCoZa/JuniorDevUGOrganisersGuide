# Guiding questions

For the sake of brevity, the Junior Dev Auckland User Group is referred to as JDA for the remainder of this booklet.

## Who runs JDA?

JDA is run by volunteers. It has a standing organising committee of 3-5 people. There is a hard limit on the number of organising committee members because over a certain size the work to align and collaborate becomes more than the benefit of the additional capacity provided by more people.

Organising committee members are expected to reguarly be involved in UG meetings but are not required to be at every event.

If an existing committee member steps down, the remaining organising committee members determine if they want to fill the space with a new organising committee member. Anyone can be put forward for consideration but the decision on whether the candidate ultimately becomes an organising committee member sits with the remaining organisig committee memebers still serving. It is determined by majority vote.

New committee members are taken on for a trial perod before becoming permanent organising committee members - this gives them time to establish what they are getting involved in and whether they have capacity to meaninfully contribute. It also allows existing committee members to determine if the new committee member works well with the group.

## What are the organising committee responsibilities?

Various organiser responsibilities include:
* Event host
* Venue organiser
* Thank you gift organiser
* Registration coordinator
* Door duty
* Food organiser

In addition to these dedicated responsibilities, there are several responsibilities that are shared across the organising committee. These include:

* Updating the Meetup site for new events
* Identifying and approaching new speakers and topics
* Deciding when events will happen and who will present at what event

## How does the organsiing committee communicate?

Most communication is done via Slack in the [AklJrDev Slack group](akljrdev.slack.com). We occaisonally organise online catch ups to sync up on speakers and upcoming events.

## Where does JDA meet?

We are an in person user group meaning we meet face to face in Auckland.  We currently meet at Xero's offices in Parnell. We try keep the same venue for meetings because:

* It provides predictability for members attending the group (once you have figured out park, transport etc it's a known entity)  
* It simplifies organising events (making sure the venue is booked and available, that we have the right seating, that projectors are working)  
* Xero covers the cost of food which attracts attendees and reduces the user groups operating costs  
* Xero's intentions around hosting and giving back to the community appear genuine  

We do not live stream meetings because we feel this detracts and complicates organising in-person meetings.

## What do our regular meetings look like?

Our standard bi-monthly meeting consists of two speakers - first speaker covers a topic for 10 minutes, second speaker covers a topic for 20 minutes.

Start time
Mingling - 15 minutes
Welcomes - 5 minutes
First speaker - 10 minutes
Second speaker - 20 minutes
Food / conversation - 30 minutes

Total meeting time ~ 60 to 70 minutes.

## What topics are covered in our events?

We like to have a mix of "technical" and "soft topics". We want topics that aren't too niche/narrow use cases so that the majority of people will get benefit from it. 

Some examples of topics that have happened in the past...
* 5 things about git  
* Tips to effectively use the command line  
* Lessons learned from pair programming  
* What's TDD  
* 3 different language paradigms (Functional, Object Oriented & Procedural)  
* 4 things everyone should know about HTML  
* Learn how to learn  
* Expectations vs Reality - Life as a Software Developer  
* Dealing with tech debt  
* Different ways to pair program effectively  
* It's testing time  
* Solid  

## How does planning for events happen?

We use a Google Sheet called [Speakers and Talks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XhQ1aYOzX1wR9nFpM881VYj3oxLeBhN5jlZYMvG7z6A/edit?usp=sharing) to plan/co-ordinate what's been done for each event.
For each event we are intentional around being who is performing what role so that things run smoothly and everyone has a good experience.

## General guidelines for our site and events

### Highly Encouraged

1. Questions/answers/comments/additions to any of the JuniorDev Auckland events
3. Connecting with other community members

### What Is Not Allowed

1. Job Postings - Everyone in this community has probably experienced the deluge of recruiting emails and announcements.   

2. Product/Event Promotion - Please no promoting your own products/services/events. This discussion board is not to be used for marketing purposes.  

3. Content Promotion - Please no promoting your own content unless it is highly relevant to a questions/discussion.  


## What are our expectations on attendees at events?

Attend when you can, we like to see regular faces but also welcome the once off visitors.
The user group is for learning. We don't expect attendees to actively be recruiting during the meeting.
We expect attendees to abide by our code of conduct rules.

## Are there other chapters of Junior Dev?

We believe there are other chapters of Junior Dev out there however we are not sure if they are still running and we have no requirement to have aligned values, views of meeting formats.
