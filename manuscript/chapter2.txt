# Guiding questions

For the sake of brevity, the Junior Dev Auckland User Group is referred to as JDA for the remainder of this booklet.

## Who runs JDA?

JDA is run by volunteers. It has a standing organising committee of 3-5 people. There is a hard limit on the number of organising committee members because over a certain size the work to align and collaborate becomes more than the benefit of the additional capacity provided by more people.

Organising committee members are expected to reguarly be involved in UG meetings but are not required to be at every event.

If an existing committee member steps down, the remaining organising committee determine if they want to fill the space with a new organising committee member. Anyone can be put forward for consideration but the decision on whether they ultimately become an organising committee member sits with the organising committee memebers still serving. It is determined by majority vote.

New committee members are taken on for a trial perod before becoming permanent organising committee members - this gives them time to establish what they are getting involved in and whether they have capacity to meaninfully contribute. It also allows existing committee members to determine if the new committee member works well with the group.

## What are the organising committee responsibilities?

* Updating the Meetup site for new events
* Identifying and approaching new speakers and topics
* Deciding when events will happen and who will present at what event


## Where do we meet?

JDA is an in person user group. We meet face to face in Auckland. We do not live stream meetings because we feel this detracts and complicates organising in-person meetings.

We meet at Xero's offices in Parnell. We try keep the same venue for meetings because:

* It provides predictability for members attending the group (once you have figured out park, transport etc it's a known entity)  
* It simplifies organising events (making sure it is booked and available, we have the right seating, access, projectors working)  
* Xero covers the cost of food which attracts attendees and reduces the user groups operating costs  
* Xero's intentions around hosting and giving back to the community appear genuine  

## What do our regular meetings look like?

Our standard bi-monthly meeting consists of two speakers - first speaker covers a topic for 10 minutes, second speaker covers a topic for 20 minutes.

Start time
Mingling - 15 minutes
Welcomes - 5 minutes
First speaker - 10 minutes
Second speaker - 20 minutes
Food / conversation - 30 minutes

Total meeting time ~ 60 to 70 minutes.

## Planning events

We use a Google Sheet called [Speakers and Talks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XhQ1aYOzX1wR9nFpM881VYj3oxLeBhN5jlZYMvG7z6A/edit?usp=sharing) to plan/co-ordinate what's been done for each event.

## What are your JuniorDev UG attendee expectations?

Attend when you can, we like to see regular faces but also welcome the once off visitors.
The user group is for learning. We don't expect attendees to actively be recruiting during the meeting.
We expect attendees to abide by our code of conduct rules.

## Are there other chapters of Junior Dev?

We believe there are other chapters of Junior Dev out there however we are not sure if they are still running and we have no requirement to have aligned values, views of meeting formats.
